This is the changelog for sg3_utils_lib.
This is a stripped down and possibly temporary subset of the
sg3_utils package with include and library files but without
the source for the utilities. It is provided so that packages
using the library from sg3_utils (e.g. sdparm and ddpt) can
be built.

Changelog for sg3_utils_lib-1.00 [20171106] [svn: r2]
  - copy the include and lib directories from sg3_utils
    revision 730.
